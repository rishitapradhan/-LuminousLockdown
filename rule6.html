        <h1>Write a Song</h1>
        <p>If you have a musical persuasion, you could channel your 
            current emotions into a song or even an entire album of them. 
            If youâ€™re not sure where to start a songwriting course could 
            get you into the right frame of mind, and you can even start 
            making some Spotify playlists in the meantime to get inspired.
