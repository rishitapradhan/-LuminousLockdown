        <h1>Write a Novel</h1>
        <p>Is it time for you to create rather than consuming?

            If you’ve always wanted to write a novel but 
            never found the time or inspiration, this is 
            your chance. Apparently Shakespeare wrote King 
            Lear in isolation during the plague, so maybe 
            this is when you’ll write your opus.
